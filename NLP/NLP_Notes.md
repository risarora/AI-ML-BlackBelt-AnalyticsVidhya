# NLP
## Basic Steps of NLP

* Tokenization
* Text Normalization
* Parts-of-Speech Tagging
* Dependency Parsing

## Corpus, Token and N-Grams
Corpus is a collection of text data
Token
N-Grams groups of N words.
* Unigrams
* Bigrams
* TriGrams

## Tokenization
* White Space Tokenization
* Reg Ex Tokenization

## Normalization
* Convert tokens to base form of a word aka Morpheme
* Structure of token : **prefix** - **morpheme** - **suffix**

### Techniques of  Normalization:

* Stemming - Primitive

---|---|---

* Lemmitization - Advanced based on vocabulary, word structure, part of speech tags and grammer relations .
Run



#### Part of Speech Tags
  Nouns
  Verbs
  Adjectives
  Adverbs

##### Defined by relations
  Text Cleaning
  Feature Engineering tasks
  Word sense disambiguous

#### Consituency Grammer
##### Dependency Grammer


Used for :-
* Named entity recognition
* Question Answering System
* Coreference Resolution


## Named entity recognition
* It is a two step process
* Named Entity Extraction
* Names Entity Classification

#### Named Entity Extraction
* Identification of noun phrases.
* Classify the Named Entities on various classes
* Entity Linking - Associate an entity to a dictionary(Ontologies)

* Issues faced when classifying NER
  * Updates
  * Name Variations
  * Multiple categories for same name
  * Non Capitilization
